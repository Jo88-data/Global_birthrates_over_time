# Global_birthrates_over_time
Data Visualisation of the change in global birthrates between 1965-2021. R studio was used to code the data visualisation.
This was created as an assignment for my Master's study, where I had to take a poorly designed data visualisation and redesign it.
The dataset used was from the <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/downloads?folder=Standard%20Projections&group=Most%20used">United Nations World Population Prospects 2024</a>. 
The original data visualisation was from Visual Capitalist's 2023 article, <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/charted-rapid-decline-of-global-birth-rates/">Declining Birth Rates: Live births per 1,000 people for the most populous countries in 2021.</a> 
Using R studio with libraries (ggplot2, readxl, dplyr, rnaturalearth, rnaturalearthdata, sf) I transformed the original faceted line graph into a faceted choropleth.
